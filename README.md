# Patient-Readmission-Analysis
Predictive modeling and analysis of hospital readmissions using SQL and healthcare data. Includes data cleaning, EDA, and dashboard visualization.

Project goal:<br>
The goal of this project is to analyze hospital patient data to identify key factors associated with 30-day readmissions for patients with a diagnosis of diabetes. By building predictive models and data visualizations, this project demonstrates how data analytics can help hospitals improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.

Dataset Source:<br>
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandao/diabetes?resource=download&select=diabetic_data.csv

Process:<br>
Cleaning -> EDA -> Modeling -> Dashboard

Steps Taken:<br>
-Defined the objective: analyze diabetes-related data to uncover trends and insights.<br>
-Determined key question to answer: What is the main driver of hospital readmissions within 30 days?<br>
-Collect the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandao/diabetes?select=diabetic_data.csv<br>
-Cleaned the data which involved identifying and removing critical values, null or empty fields, filling in missing data, correcting typos, standardizing formats and numeric values, removing duplicate values, exluding cases that did not meet project criteria, transforming data, and validating data.<br>
-Exploratory data analysis: Ran SQL queries to summarize patient demographics, outcomes, and other key metrics.<br>
-Created charts and visualizations to identify patterns.<br>
-Data visualization: Built graphs in Tableau to highlight trends and generate visual insights such as discharge paterns, patient distribution, or correlations.<br>
-Organized files in GitHub.<br>
-Presentation preparation: Summarized keys findings into slides, including charts and tables to support conclusions. Prepared talking points for analysis and insights.<br>
